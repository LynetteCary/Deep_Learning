# **Deep Learning Model Evaluation - Closing Prices vs. FNG Values**
### *by Lynette Cary*

#
## **Which model has a lower loss?**
The model that uses the previous closing prices has the lower loss compared to the model that uses FNG values.  The lower loss indicates the better model.  The loss continues to decrease after each epoch that also indicates how well the model performs.   

#
## **Which model tracks the actual values better over time?**
The model that uses the previous closing prices tracks the actual values better over time compared to the predicted values based on the plot.  

#
## **Which window size works best for the model?**
 The window size of 10 was used for both models to predict closing prices.  A change in using a smaller window size  for each model did not provide a great difference in the accuracy between the predicted values versus the real values.
